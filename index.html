          <h2 id="vision-who">Who</h2>
          <p>We are a formal, personal, long term, peer to peer mentorship organization focused on creating networks of skilled developers from all walks of life.
            <br>
            We are PHP developers first and foremost - but that is not all we do nor is it the only skill listed on our resume.
            <br>
            We are both mentors and apprentices, teachers, counselors, and we're not in this for profit but for the end result, a strong community of talented developers doing some fabulous things.
            <br>
            We give back to the community as much as we take, we build up not tear down, and above all we believe in "play nice" and "code well"</p>
          <h2 id="vision-what">What</h2>
          <p>Mentorship is a personal developmental relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.
            <br>
            It's more then just answering questions or providing help, it's about learning, communication, and interaction.
            <br>
            There are many different types of mentorships and mentorship programs, we have chosen a specific set of facets that describe mentorship for our program.
            <br>
            There are mentorship organizations which have very formal procedures and there are also much more informal mentorships. Because we have both rules for relationships and procedures for mentorships this is a formal organization.
            <br>
            Not every mentorship relationship needs to be or should be the kind where you invite them to your wedding, but we do focus more on personal involvement between two people, which makes our organization more personal then professional.
            <br>
            Although short term, intensive mentorships can be useful for specific skills, we feel that the end result of a good mentorship is a healthy career in the long term. This means our mentorships should be a rich and ever changing career-long experience.
            <br>
            Although group mentorships work well at the beginning of a career we feel the most best bang for your buck works best in face to face relationships.</p>
          <h2 id="vision-when">When</h2>
          <p>The idea for a mentorship organization for technical communities is not a new one, but a common place to come together with some basic rules and guidelines where people could connect with each other and get questions answered in a common way is the ultimate goal. Sometimes a little organization and beaurocracy makes things that were previously difficult much easier.</p>
          <h2 id="vision-where">Where</h2>
          <p>We communicate in various ways - from a google groups mailing list to an irc channel, wikis and example code directories on github, and our website. We also encourage face-to-face interaction - through user groups, meetups, conferences. We use technology from google hangouts to skype to irc and other chat programs. Communication is the key to any good relationship.</p>
          <h2 id="vision-why">Why</h2>
          <p>Mentoring is great for your career. It provides * Information - technology moves fast, get help and insight into your every day work * Recognition - as a mentor, your apprentice's work and progress will reflect on you * Role modeling - as an apprentice you will have people to look up to, so you can map where you want to be in the future * Advice - get insights into your strengths and weaknesses as well as guidance on where to go next * Networking - find opportunities and meet people you never would have before * Interaction - regular communication helps you introduce more social interaction into your work * Intangibles - humans want to do things that make use feel good, from giving back knowledge received as an apprentice to a new apprentice or just helping someone with a problem</p>

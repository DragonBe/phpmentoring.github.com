          <p>From Minion to Mentor one Dev at a Time</p>
          <p>Welcome to phpMentoring - an organization dedicated to improving PHP developers everywhere.</p>
Who
We are a formal, personal, long term, peer to peer mentorship organization focused on creating networks of
skilled developers from all walks of life.

We are PHP developers first and foremost - but that is not all we do nor is it the only skill listed on our resume. 

We are both mentors and minions, teachers, counselors, and we're not in this for profit but for the end result, a 

strong community of talented developers doing some fabulous things.

We give back to the community as much as we take, we build up not tear down, and above all we believe in "play 

nice" and "code well"

What

Mentorship is a personal developmental relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps 

to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.

It's more then just answering questions or providing help, it's about learning, communication, and interaction.

We refer to Mentors as "Masters" and Mentees/proteges/apprentices as "Minions" just to be funny.

There are many different types of mentorships and mentorship programs, we have chosen a specific set of facets that 

describe mentorship for our program.

There are mentorship organizations which have very formal procedures and there are also much more informal 

mentorships.  Because we have both rules for relationships and procedures for mentorships this is a formal 

organization.

Not every mentorship relationship needs to be or should be the kind where you invite them to your wedding, but we 

do focus more on personal involvement between two people, which makes our organization more personal then 

professional.

Although short term, intensive mentorships can be useful for specific skills, we feel that the end result of a good 

mentorship is a healthy career in the long term.  This means our mentorships should be a rich and ever changing 

career-long experience.

Although group mentorships work well at the beginning of a career we feel the most best bang for your buck works 

best in face to face relationships.

When

The idea for a mentorship organization for technical communities is not a new one, but a common place to come 

together with some basic rules and guidelines where people could connect with each other and get questions answered 

in a common way is the ultimate goal.  Sometimes a little organization and beaurocracy makes things that were 

previously difficult much easier.

Where

We communicate in various ways - from a google groups mailing list to an irc channel, wikis and example code 

directories on github, and our website.  We also encourage face-to-face interaction - through user groups, meetups, 

conferences.  We use technology from google hangouts to skype to irc and other chat programs.  Communication is the 

key to any good relationship.

Why
Mentoring is great for your career.  It provides 
Information - technology moves fast, get help and insight into your every day work
Recognition - as a mentor, your minion's work and progress will reflect on you
Role modeling - as a minion you will have people to look up to, so you can map where you want to be in the future
Advice - get insights into your strengths and weaknesses as well as guidance on where to go next
Networking - find opportunities and meet people you never would have before
Interaction - regular communication helps you introduce more social interaction into your work
Intangibles - humans want to do things that make use feel good, from giving back knowledge received as a minion to 

a new minion or just helping someone with a problem
